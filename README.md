# My Django-Ecom-App retry
 The old one is dead...

I am working on being a back-end engineer, so I start learning Python and using django frame to build a E-commerce website for study purpose.

I've tried building this website multiple times, but some of them look bad so I deleted their commit, this website won't make any money, all of the products are data and still I don't have the operating rights to run these products as well as I do not actually own them.

PayPal paying function is working, please use sandbox account.

Credit Cards paying isn't working, click the button will create order at the back-end of PostgreSQL on railway or localhost's PostgreSQL.
